Apollo is an election monitoring platform that is designed
to use the Parallel Voting Tabulation methodology of election
monitoring to collect, store and analyse election data. This
data is submitted by election observers using text messaging
and provides tools to enable data managers and clerks manage
the collected data. Apollo is capable of validating collected
data and providing user-friendly error reports to enable
election observers self-correct and resend their information.
